    "> The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of my knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews paper, though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.\n",

    "Document/Text classification is one of the important and typical task in supervised machine learning (ML). Assigning categories to documents, which can be a web page, library book, media articles, gallery etc. has many applications like e.g. spam filtering, email routing, sentiment analysis etc. In this article, I would like to demonstrate how we can do text classification using python, scikit-learn and little bit of NLTK.\n",

    "Text files are actually series of words (ordered). In order to run machine learning algorithms we need to convert the text files into numerical feature vectors. We will be using bag of words model for our example. Briefly, we segment each text file into words (for English splitting by space), and count # of times each word occurs in each document and finally assign each word an integer id. Each unique word in our dictionary will correspond to a feature (descriptive feature).\n",
